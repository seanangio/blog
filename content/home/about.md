Since graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 2011, I spent five years in education-related ventures in India and China, leading management of large scale projects for government agencies and universities, requiring policy research, grant writing, event management, workshop delivery, digital project management, and social media marketing.

In the past two years, I have immersed myself in the world of data science, earning Coursera specializations in data science, statistics with R, and Python. Please visit my Github page for recent coursework. On this blog, I will highlight some of my data projects.
