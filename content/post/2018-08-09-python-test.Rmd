In order to brush up on my Python skills, I recently completed the [Introduction to Python Scripting Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-scripting-in-python) on Coursera from Rice University. Four brief courses introduce Python Programming Essentials, Data Representations, Data Analysis and Data Visualization.

The specialization requires writing short Python scripts of a few specified functions, each assessed by a machine grader. The final projects in the Data Visualization course introduce the Pygal plotting library.

One of these projects requires unifying World Bank GDP data with Pygal country codes in order to construct a world choropleth for a given year. Below is one example plot output. Although the built-in tooltips are nice, the default color palette makes it difficult to easily distinguish differences in GDP values, even after converting to a log scale.

The penultimate project required constructing line plots of World Bank GDP data for a given selection of countries, again using the Pygal plotting library.

My scripts for producing these plots can be found in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/seanangio/rice_isp).
