<p>After giving a talk introducing geospatial data visualization with the <code>sf</code>, <code>leaflet</code> and <code>shiny</code> packages at an <a href="https://twitter.com/rusersdelhi">R Users Delhi</a> Meetup, I wrote a blog covering the points of the talk. Video and slides are also available. You can find it on the Social Cops blog <a href="https://blog.socialcops.com/technology/data-science/shiny-electricity-latrine-water-india/">here</a>.</p>
