After giving a talk introducing geospatial data visualization with the `sf`, `leaflet` and `shiny` packages at an [R Users Delhi](https://twitter.com/rusersdelhi) Meetup, I wrote a blog covering the points of the talk. Video and slides are also available. You can find it on the Social Cops blog [here](https://blog.socialcops.com/technology/data-science/shiny-electricity-latrine-water-india/).
