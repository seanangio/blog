<p>In order to brush up on my Python skills, I recently completed the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-scripting-in-python">Introduction to Python Scripting Specialization</a> on Coursera from Rice University. Four brief courses introduce Python Programming Essentials, Data Representations, Data Analysis and Data Visualization.</p>
<p>The specialization requires writing short Python scripts of a few specified functions, each assessed by a machine grader. The final projects in the Data Visualization course introduce the Pygal plotting library.</p>
<p>One of these projects requires unifying World Bank GDP data with Pygal country codes in order to construct a world choropleth for a given year. Below is one example plot output. Although the built-in tooltips are nice, the default color palette makes it difficult to easily distinguish differences in GDP values, even after converting to a log scale.</p>

<p>The penultimate project required constructing line plots of World Bank GDP data for a given selection of countries, again using the Pygal plotting library.</p>

<p>My scripts for producing these plots can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/seanangio/rice_isp">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
